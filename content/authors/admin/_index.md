As a postdoctoral researcher in biomechanics, I am passionate about understanding and modeling the principles that govern animal movement. Thanks to my thesis in robotics, this research theme allows me to address scientific questions such as the biomechanical aspects of movement, motor control and sports performance using advanced robotics and numerical optimization tools.
